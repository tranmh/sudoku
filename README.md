# Sudoku (Go) â€” Web UI\n\nThis repository contains a Sudoku web application written in Go using a clean architecture. It includes a solver (DLX planned), generator, validator, and hint system (to be implemented).\n\n## Quick Start\n```bash\nmake tidy\nmake build\nmake run # starts on :8080\n```\nOpen http://localhost:8080\n\n## Cross Compilation\n```bash\nmake cross\n# outputs in ./bin for Windows/Linux (amd64), CGO disabled\n```\n\n## Project Layout\n```\n/cmd/sudoku-web        # entrypoint (web server)\n/internal              # domain, ports, solver, generator, usecases, adapters\n/web/templates         # Go HTML templates\n/web/static            # JS/CSS (embedded)\n/docs                  # design docs\n```\n\n## Design Document\nSee `docs/high-level-design.md` for goals, architecture, algorithms, and acceptance criteria.\n\n## Status\nScaffold created; HTTP endpoints and core algorithms are stubbed and will be implemented next.\n
